# Approach
this question wants to count sub strings with same amount of 0s and 1s and these 0s should be continued and 1s are also continued; 
they cannot be separately occured with same amount. 
a sub sub string can also count once when its father "sub string" already count one 
the challenging part is how to recursively call the same func to count a string and its sub string 

compress the string by the length of its sub strings' 0s and 1s
so, 001100 becomes [2,2,2] OR 000110 becomes [3,2,1]
the shorter length is the sliced count for this pair, (3,2) --> 2 and (2,1) --> 1
then, we add up 2 and 1 and get 3 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), we scan the whole string for frequency into a list O(n), then pair each neighbor frequency in this list O(n), so two O(n) is O(n)
- Space: O(n), we store the frequency in a list, worst case will be the string length.
