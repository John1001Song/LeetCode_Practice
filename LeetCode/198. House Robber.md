## Approach
Use dynamic program to recursively solve the sub questions with memory dict applied  
Core concept is to compare
	- rob current house and potentially rob neighbor's neighbor 
	- rob neighbor (it is skipped in current index)
This comparison happens on all indexes

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) since the memory dict is applied, the computing space on repeated index won't required to stack, and the results can be taken from the memory dict.
