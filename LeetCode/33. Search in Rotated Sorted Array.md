## Approach
The idea is to limit smaller and smaller range to find the target and eventually when the range has 1 value left to compare with the target. If it is same as target, then found, otherwise, -1.  
This array is into two sub arrays based on the setting, if we cut this whole array into two parts, obvious, one of the left or right part is sorted and the other one is not sorted. Then, we check if the target is within the sorted part. If yes, we narrow down the range, and see if the target is in the left or right part of this sorted part. Loop this step until we find or no find. The other case is no, which means the target is in the un-sorted part, then we split the un-sorted part, which will give us left and right parts, and one is sorted, the other is un-sorted. So, same loop as mentioned, we iterate and eventually get the last value to compare. 

## Complexity
- Time: O(log n)
- Space: O(1)
