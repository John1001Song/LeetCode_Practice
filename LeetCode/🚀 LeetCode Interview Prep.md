# 🚀 LeetCode Interview Prep: From 1 hr/question → 2 questions/40 min

## 🎯 Goal:
Develop the speed, accuracy, and intuition needed to solve 2 LeetCode questions in 40 minutes — just like in real coding interviews.

---

## 📚 4-Stage Practice Plan

---

## 🌱 Stage 1: Accuracy Over Speed (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Build strong problem-solving intuition

### ✅ Daily Practice (1 Question/day):
1. Pick 1 LeetCode problem (easy/medium) from a **specific theme**.
2. Spend **up to 60 minutes** solving it yourself.
3. If stuck after 30 mins, ask ChatGPT:  
   _"Can you give me a high-level strategy for solving this problem, but no code?"_
4. Implement and debug the solution yourself.
5. Write a quick reflection:
   - What was the key trick or pattern?
   - What would I do differently next time?

### 🧠 Weekly Theme Example:

| Week | Topic                | Key Skills Built                       |
|------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Arrays + HashMaps    | Sliding window, prefix sum, frequency  |
| 2    | Recursion + Backtracking | Tree traversal, permutations     |

---

## ⚒️ Stage 2: Pattern Drilling (Weeks 3–4)

**Goal:** Improve speed by recognizing and solving repeated patterns

### ✅ Practice Plan:
1. Focus on **1 pattern** per day.
2. Solve **2–3 variations** of the same pattern in one sitting.
3. Timebox each problem to **30 minutes max**.
4. Review only the approach if stuck, then retry it the next day.

### 💡 Example (Binary Search Drill):
- LeetCode 33: Search in Rotated Array
- LeetCode 34: First and Last Position of Element
- LeetCode 74: Search a 2D Matrix

---

## 🧪 Stage 3: Interview Simulation (Weeks 5–6)

**Goal:** Solve **2 questions in 40 minutes** under real interview constraints

### ✅ Practice (3–4 sessions/week):
1. Choose:
   - 1 Easy + 1 Medium  
   - or 2 Mediums
2. Set a **40-minute timer** ⏱️
3. Solve both questions with **no help**.
4. Afterward:
   - Reflect on what slowed you down.
   - Track mistakes.
   - Revisit the same pair of problems 3 days later to improve timing.

### 📌 Track your session:
- Time spent reading
- Time spent planning
- Time spent coding/debugging

---

## 🔁 Stage 4: Warm-up + Maintenance (Weeks 7+)

**Goal:** Maintain sharpness and reinforce key patterns

### ✅ Daily Routine:
- **10 min**: Easy problem warm-up
- **30 min**: 1 medium-level timed session
- **2–3x/week**: Full 40-min 2-question simulation

## 🛠️ Helpful Tools

### 📊 Problem Tracker (Google Sheet / Notion):

| Field          | Example                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Problem        | LeetCode 560                   |
| Topic          | Prefix Sum                     |
| Time Taken     | 27 min                         |
| Mistakes Made  | Missed edge case               |
| Solution Pattern | HashMap + Sliding Window    |

### 📔 Review Notebook:
Write 1-page summaries on:
- How to solve problems of type X (e.g., binary search on answer)
- Common edge cases and tricks

### 🧠 Flashcards for Core Concepts:
- When to use sliding window?
- How to debug off-by-one errors in recursion?
- What are binary search base conditions?

## 💬 Final Tips

- Don't skip the **struggle phase** — growth happens there.
- ChatGPT is your **coach**, not your coder.
- Revisit problems: **repetition = mastery**.
- Simulate interviews frequently.
- Build confidence through **pattern recognition and speed.**
