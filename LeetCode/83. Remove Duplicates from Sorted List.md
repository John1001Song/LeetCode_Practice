# Approach
the question wants to remove duplicated elements and we can check cur node's neighbors until its next neighbor is different  
use a cur node, compare cur with cur.next, if same, cur.next is the duplicate one, pass, if different, shift cur to cur.next  

# Cost
- Time: O(n), iterate all nodes once
- Space: O(1), use one node as cur pointer
