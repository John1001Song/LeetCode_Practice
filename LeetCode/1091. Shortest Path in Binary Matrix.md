## Approach
Need to move from the top left cell to bottom right cell and find the shortest path.  
Use BFS to find out the shortest path without recursive function call.  
1. check the corner cases: 
	- if this grid is size 1
	- if the starting or ending cell is already 1 (non-vistable)
2. create a double end queue to store cells that can be visited.
3. create a direction list, so we can iterate all 8 directions on row idx and column idx.
4. Loop the queue
	- first check if current row idx and col idx are at n-1, which is the bottom right corner
		- if yes, path found and return distance 
	- at current row and col idx, check its 8 directions
		- only when this direction row idx and col idx are in the valid range and cell not visited
		- if good to check, push this cell to queue with distance + 1 

## Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n^2)
