# Approach
since it is sorted, we can insert or find this target at a position by comparing the value in middle range, then we can meet the requirement log n time complexity

in general case, we need to compare the value in middle, if it is smaller than target, we take the right side, if it is larger, take the left side, if it is equal to this target, we find it. 


# Cost
- Time: O(log n), every time, we cut in the middle 
- Space: O(1), except for storage space of the list, we have variables to store values only
