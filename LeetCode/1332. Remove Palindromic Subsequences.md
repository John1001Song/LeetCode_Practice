# Approach
This question has a smart way to solve, instead of normal method.  
Since, this string has only 'a' and 'b', and dis-adjust same letters can still be considered as palindromic, we can remove all 'a's, then 'b's, or vise verse.  
If the question changes to contain multiple letters like 'a', 'b', 'c', then we need to use normal approach.  

Now, we check if this string has only 'a' or 'b', then, return 1.  
Then, if the string is palindromic, return 1, else, 2

# Cost
- Time: O(n), check if 'a' or 'b' only in string, time cost is 2*n, then check if this string is palindromic, n/2, so total is O(n)
- Space: O(n), just store the orignal string
