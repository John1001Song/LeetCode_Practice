# Dutch National Flag Algorithm Explanation

## Initialization

- **low = 0, mid = 0, high = len(nums) - 1**

  These pointers are used to partition the array into three regions:
  - Elements before `low` will be `0`s.
  - Elements between `low` and `mid` will be `1`s.
  - Elements after `high` will be `2`s.

## Loop Until `mid > high`

During each iteration, we evaluate `nums[mid]` and proceed as follows:

### Case: `nums[mid] == 0`

- This means the element belongs at the beginning.
- **Action:**
  - Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[low]`.
  - Increment both `low` and `mid`.

### Case: `nums[mid] == 1`

- The element `1` belongs in the middle.
- **Action:**
  - No swap is needed.
  - Simply increment `mid`.

### Case: `nums[mid] == 2`

- The element belongs at the end.
- **Action:**
  - Swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[high]`.
  - Decrement `high`.
  - **Note:** Do not immediately increment `mid` after this swap, as the new element swapped into `nums[mid]` might be `0`, `1`, or `2` and needs to be evaluated.

## Termination

The loop terminates when `mid` exceeds `high`. At this point:

- **Elements before `low`:** All are `0`s.
- **Elements between `low` and `high` (inclusive):** All are `1`s.
- **Elements after `high`:** All are `2`s.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1) for operating

# Solution 2: bubble sort
Use two for loops or while loops, between current one and next one, swap larger value to next one, repeat this process until the outer loop reaches last two. 

## Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1)
