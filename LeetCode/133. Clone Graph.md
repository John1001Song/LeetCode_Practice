## DFS Approach 
- the overall pipelne is check current node, is it copied, 
- then recursive to its neighbors, check one by one if they are copied
- each recurisve will return the copied node and add the neighbor one by one to the self.neighbors list 

## Caution
- input for this function is a node, and output is the copy of this node 
- input and output are not lists

## Complexity
- Time: O(V+E) not use O(n)
- Space: O(n)
