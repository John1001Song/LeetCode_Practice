# Approach
This question asks for even and odd pair for each neighbor numbers in the given list. So we can just iterate all numbers and check sum of each pair. If sum is even, return false, else, return true. Because even+even = even and even+odd = odd. 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), iterate the list once and we know results
- Space: O(n) for list storage.
