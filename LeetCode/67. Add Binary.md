# Approach
Convert two strings into lists and make up the length difference by 0s  
Add them up from lower position to  higher position  with an "addon" digit  
Reverse the result list and return 

# Cost:
- Time: O(m+n), assume longer string has length n and shorter one is m, so convert two strings to lists costs m+n, and add them up is n, reverse the result is another n, thus total is m+n
- Space: O(m+n), we need to keep the two lists and the result list
