# Approach
the question wants a sqrt value round down to a nearest integer  
based on math, sqrt value is slightly bigger than half of given number   
for a simply try, we can just take half, then add 1 every time until its power of 2 just over the given number   

# Cost
- Time: O(√x), first while costs O(log x), but the 2nd while is O(√x). The 2nd while takes steps from √x/2 to √x. Thus, the domainant factor is O(√x).
- Space: O(1)
