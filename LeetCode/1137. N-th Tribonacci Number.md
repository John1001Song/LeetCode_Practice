# Analysis
This question is a recursive func to call itself and it has a time limit on the computing. Thus, the key is to add a memory structure to store the calculation results from previous computing steps. 

# Cost
## Solution 1
Time cost: O(n)  
Space cost: O(n) where mem table takes O(n) + the depth of the func calling is O(n), thus, total is O(n)

## Solution 2
Time cost: O(n)
Space cost: O(1)
