# Approach
	we need to compare two trees  
	we can compare the node.val first, then node.left, then node.right  
	if find difference, return false  
	if same, continue to next node.  
	return true after the all the node checking   
The key here is to define the recursive function and when to call it  
In this question, it needs to call self.isSameTree and cannot call isSameTree directly because it is a class method instead of a isolated function. 

# Cost
- Time: O(k), where k = min(m, n) and m = q's nodes, n = p's nodes
- Space: O(min(height(p), height(q))), consider p and q are balanced trees or chain-style trees or mixed
