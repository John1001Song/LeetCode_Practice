# Approach
Iterate all digits, based on their positions, times 10s catering to their positions.  
Then, add up the digits and add 1 for the result.  
Then, convert this result into string and a list. And use a for loop to iterate this result list to convert all strings back to integers.

# Cost
- Time: O(n), we need to iterate this list at least 2 times.
- Space: O(n), we need store the temporary result for string list.
