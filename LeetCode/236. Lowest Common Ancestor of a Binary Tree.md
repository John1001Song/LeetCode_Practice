## DFS Approach
- Base Case:
	When you hit a node that is pp or qq, you return that node immediately.

- Recursive Case:
	You search both left and right subtrees.

- Combining Results:
    If both sides are non-null, the current node is the LCA.  
    Otherwise, you return the non-null result.

## Caution
- It is **correct to return early**: when p or q is already found and we are sure the other branch does not have p or q, then we can safely return this found p or q, because this first found p or q is the common ancestor for wanted p and q. So no need to dig deeper on this branch.  
- Be careful to define the base case, when root is None, return it

## Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n) for worst case and O(log n) for balanced tree
