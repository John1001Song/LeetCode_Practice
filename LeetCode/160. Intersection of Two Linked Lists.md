# Approach
from link A, pointer_A takes all steps until the end, then pointer_A starts from link B  
from link B, pointer_B takes all steps until the end, the pointer_B starts from link A  
the monemnt pointer_A meets pointer_B is the intersected node

the while loop will continue when pointer A and pointer B are not same node.  In the loop, when pointer A is not None, point to next node, else, switch to the other list. Same for pointer B.

after the loop, return pointer A. This moment, pointer A has two possibilities, None or the joint node. Based on the method, two pointers are guaranteed to finish at the same step. 

# Cost
- Time: O(m+n), where m and n are listA and listB length.
- Space: O(1), we have two pointers only.
