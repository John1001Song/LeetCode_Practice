# Approach 
The question wants to determine if the linked list is looped/cycle, and input does not have pos parameter  
assume all nodes are unique  
naive approach is to add all nodes into a set, if the next node is in the set, then we find a loop/cycle 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), where n is the length of list 
- Space: O(n), where n is the length of list 

# Optimal Solution
## ðŸ§¾ Code Implementation (Python)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow is fast:
                return True
        return False
