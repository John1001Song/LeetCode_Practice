## Approach
Tricky solution here is to use two lists representing two stacks  
- push function: 
	one is normal stack, appending elements one by one at the end of the list  
	the other stack compares the input with current tail, if input is smaller or equal, append this input, otherwise, append this tail again  
- pop function applies same on both stacks  
- top function applies on normal stack and return the tail 
- getMin function returns the tail of the stack containing smaller elements 

## Complexity
- Time & Space: 
	- push: O(1)
	- getMin: O(1)
	- pop: O(1)
	- top: O(1)
