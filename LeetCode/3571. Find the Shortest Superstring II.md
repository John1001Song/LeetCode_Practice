# Approach
This questions asks to check the prefix and suffix of two strings, find the longest common sub string and attach the remaining difference.  
The tricky way here is to use .endswith() twice. The reason is that s1.endswith(s2) checks the suffix of s1 with prefix of s2, then use s2.endswith(s1) checks the suffix of s2 with prefix of s1. So, we can cover the cases we need, like how two strings overlaps, one on head part, and the other on tail part. So, we use same function easier approach.  

# Cost
- Time: O(n^2), assume smaller size of two strings is n, then, we need to compare the shorter one all the letters with longer string. 
- Space: O(m+n), assume string sizes are m and n. we don't duplicate additional space, just iterate the original list.
