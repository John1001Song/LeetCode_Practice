# Approach
The question wants to check if the tree is symmetric  
we need to compare left and right, right and left  
So, each time we need to iterate nodes by left vs right  
This approach trickly way is to introduce two trees, copy of original, easy to work on it

# Cost 
- Time: O(n), n is the length of tree
- Space: O(h), h is the tree height, h = log n or h = n, depends on tree style
