# Approach
this question has 3 tasks:  
1. lower all letters  
2. remove all non-alph chars  
3. check forward and backward  
we can iterate the string and do the first 2 tasks at the same step, then check the result 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), where n is the string length. 
- Space: O(n), where n is the string length.
