# Approach
Iterate char by char among all strings  
Find the min length among strings (not necessary), iterate limit is set; in each iteration, add char from each string to a temp set, if the set size is not 1, drop it and return the existing prefix, if the set size is 1, add this char to prefix. Last step is to return the prefix 

# Cost
Time: O(k*j) k is the number of strings, j is the length of common prefix  
Space: O(j)
