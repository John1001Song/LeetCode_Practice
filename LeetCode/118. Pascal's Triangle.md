# Approach
This question asks for sum of list elements from previous list to build current list.  
It requires the for loop with correct index and boundary values.  
Tricky thing here is to observe how to do the calculation based previous list. 

# Cost
- Time: O(n^2), n is the number of rows
- Space: O(n^2), 1+2+3+...+n = O(n^2)
