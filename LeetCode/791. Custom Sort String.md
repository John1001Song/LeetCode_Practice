## Approach
The question wants to have charaters in string "s" to appear in the order in the string "order". "s" and "order" may have characters that do not show in the other string, thus we need to filter their common characters.  
Iterate all characters in "s" and see if it is in the "order", if yes, put into a dict, whose key is this character and value is its frequency. Then, loop characters in "order", it they are in this dict, if yes, append it based on its frequency into the output list.  
return this list to string
