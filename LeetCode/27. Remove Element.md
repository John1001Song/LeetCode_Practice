# Approach
Two methods:  
1. Use two indces, reader and writer to indicate the positions of next element and place to assign an element. The reader will go through all elements. Once it finds an element equal to given val, reader index + 1, and writer index do nothing. If reader index find the element is not equal to the given val, assign this element at the writer index, then writer index + 1. We continue the loop until the reader index reaches the length of the list nums. 
2. Use for loop, and a index k. Now, we think from another view: we need to squeeze the nums list, any elements equal to val, should be "removed", which means, all non-val elements should be placed to left. So, we go through elements, any non-val element will be placed one by one from the left side. In the worst case, no element is equal to val, then we just put them in the same order again.
