## Approach
The key step is to sort the original interval list, so the following comparison between two intervals will be much simple than the comparison in un-sorted list  
1. sort the interval list
2. merge current interval with previous one if necessary
3. return the final result 

## Complexity
- Time: sort the interval list: O(n log n) and for loop is O(n), thus total is O(n log n)
- Space: O(n) for all intervals
