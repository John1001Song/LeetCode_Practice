## Approach 1
store all elements into dictionary, then put them into a list  
sort this list and return the first top k elements

### Complexity
Time: 
- build dict: O(n) 
- build list: O(n)
- sort list: O(n log n)
- total O(n log n)

Space:
- dict: O(n)
- list: O(n)
- overall: O(n)



## Approach 2
Use min heap as the core structure  
store all elements in dict  
push elements (freq, num) one by one into heap  
maintain k elements, pop out smallest one if reaching k  
return these k elements after iteration

### Complexity
Time:
- build dict: O(n)
- heap sort with k elements: O(n log k)
- overall: O(n log k)
 
Space:
- dictionary: O(n)
- heap: O(k)
- total O(n)
