# Approach
This question wants a sum of the path from root to its leaf, to find if one of the paths can match with targetSum.  
We can do DFS to find the first one to match, return True, or DFS to try all and return False, if not found.  
Every time, the DFS func is called, we iterate the remain variable to track the remaining val for the following children nodes levels.  

# Cost
- Time: O(h), for a balanced tree, h is log n, for a chained style tree, h is n. Another worst case, we need to go through all nodes in the tree.  
- Space: O(h), we only need to keep one path where the nodes are tracked. Once checked, they can be released. This h can be log n or n based on tree style.
