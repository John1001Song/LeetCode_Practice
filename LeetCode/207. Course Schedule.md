## Understand the Question
It asks about if one course is a prerequisit for another one. For example, 0 --> 1. If 0 --> 1 and 1 --> 0, then, it is not acceptable.  
A more complicated case: 0 --> 1 --> 2 --> 3, and 3 --> 0, then we find a cycle after several recursive search.  
Thus, we simplify this question into a directed graph and have to find the cycle within the graph. 

## Approach
1. Build a graph
Use the numGraph to generate the graph dict, where key is the course number, value is a set/list containing prerequisites
2. Define dfs function 
Check if current node status, 
	- if it is 1 visiting, then a cycle found, because this node was on doing and this recursive round, we visit it again. So, return False
	- if it is 2 visited, then no operation on it, becuase that node and its directed path to other nodes are not a cycle. So return True
	- if it is 0, unvisited, then do the recursive operation
		- first, update this node status as 1
		- then, use a for loop to iterate its prerequisites courses
		- call dfs on each prereq, any prereq returns False, return the False within the loop
		- After the loop, no False return, meaning no cycle found, so update this course node status as 2 visited, return True
3. Loop the input prerequisites
- loop all course numbers
- if the course node is not visited, call dfs function on it, if dfs return a False, return False
- after the loop, no False returned, return True  

## Caution
In order to avoid the ifinite recursive loop, we define 3 status for a node: 
- 0: unvisited: we don't know if this node will cause a cycle yet; this node and its children nodes are not searched yet
- 1: visiting: this node causes a cycle; this node is being search and in its recursive round on children nodes, we find this node again 
- 2: visited: nodes already searched, which means, from that node, no cycle found and no need to search again

Carefully read the statement, how to generate the graph properly.

## Complexity
- Time: O(V+E) and worst is O(V^2) if each node connects to all other nodes
- Space: O(V)
