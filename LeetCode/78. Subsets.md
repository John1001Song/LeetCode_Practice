## Approach
Imagine here is a tower, lower layer must be wider than the upper layer, the top layer is an empty list    
every time we introduce a new element, this element always add to all existing layers  
initial an empty  
[]  

add 1 to all layers  
[]  
[1]  

add 2 to all layers  
[2]  
[1, 2]  
attach these updated layers to tower  
[]  
[1]  
[2]  
[1, 2]  

add 3 to all layers  
[3]  
[1, 3]  
[2, 3]  
[1, 2, 3]  
attach these updated layers to tower  
[]  
[1]  
[2]  
[1, 2]  
[3]  
[1, 3]  
[2, 3]  
[1, 2, 3]  

## Complexity
- Time: O(n * 2^n)  
the outer loop has n times to run  
the inner loop on output has n times to run but its size is increasing after each outer loop iteration  
size 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> 8 ...  
thus the time cost is n * 2^n

- Space: O(2^n)  
we have n elements to save but maximum space can be observed with 2^n elements within
