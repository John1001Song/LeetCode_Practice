# Approach
We merge these two lists from tail to front, which is easier since we don't need to temporary hold the values for future places.  This is the key design here.  
After the merge step, if nums2 is used out, no operation. If nums2 still has some elements, we need to insert them to nums1 places. 

# Cost
- Time: O(m+n)
- Space: O(1)
