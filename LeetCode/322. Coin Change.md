## Approach
The easy approach is to use coins to add up and try to reach the target amount  
- How to keep choosing a minimal number of coins?  
Use a set named visited, so previous visited/reached amounts are saved and no need to re-calculate  
- How to retrieve previous coins combinations?  
Use a queue. 

## Complexity
- Time: O(amount * len(coins))
- Space: O(amount)
