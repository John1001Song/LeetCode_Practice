# Approach
we need to find all numbers from lower to upper that are not in the nums list  
the output should be list of lists, where each inner list is a range for those missing numbers' range  
The lower and upper are included in the output and all numbers in the nums list should be excluded.  

It basically, check the corner cases then consider the normal condition, lower, nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[-1], upper, where lower and upper are in the range. 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), n is nums list length 
- Space: O(n), n the output list storage, O(1) if consider only the space during computing.
