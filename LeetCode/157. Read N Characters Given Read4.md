# Approach
This question wants us to implement a read func that can read wanted length characters from a file. The core func is given, read4 and it loads 4 chars into the parameter object buf4, and then, we need to trans-load these 4 chars into the buf  
Also, we need to find out when to stop, the end of file.  
Eventually, we return the actual characters length and backend will find out if the buf is loaded correctly. 

# Cost
- Time: O(n), determined by the wanted lenth
- Cost: O(1), we just use a 4 char length list to store a chunk.
