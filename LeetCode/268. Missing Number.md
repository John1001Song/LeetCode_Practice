# Approach
this question is about given a range, which is the size of the nums
this range is determined by the size, like size is 3, then, range is 0-3
so, as described, always there is one number missing


we can use a math approach to solve it
since it should include all numbers, but it misses one
the sum of the wanted list can be known ahead
we sum up given list, and get the difference, which is the missing number

# Cost
- Time: O(n), get the sum of a list, requrie us to add elements one by one
- Space: O(n), just store the list, which is the domaint factor
