# Approach
consider the pattern, the majority element should be more than other element  
so, we check this and next element, if they are same, counter++, if they are different, counter--, we let the two elements "pop"  
since the majority is more than half, it can one-to-one pop out with other elements, definitely it will keep at the end round

# Cost
- Time: O(n), n is the length of the nums list 
- Cost: O(1), we just add variables to keep current best values
