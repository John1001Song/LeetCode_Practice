# Approach 
given the row index, we need to print out the row at that level  
so the direct approach is to start from the row 0 and add on until the target row 

# Cost 
- Time: O(n^2), 1+2+3+...+n = (1+n) * n / 2, so we have O(n^2)
- Space: O(n), where n is the nth row size. We always add current row list based on previous row, so maximum need two rows to operate.
