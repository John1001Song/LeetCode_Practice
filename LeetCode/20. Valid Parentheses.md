# Approach
based on the requirements, we can use a stack first in last out to operate on these characters  
when doing the character pair matching, it is ok for now to hard code since its number is limited  
Just need to think about the corner cases

# Cost
- Time: O(n), we iterate once for this string
- Space: O(n), in general, we may store half of the string in the memory
