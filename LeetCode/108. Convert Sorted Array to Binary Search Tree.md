# Approach
The question wants a balanced binary search tree, and the BST should have left < cur < right  
The given list nums is increasing order, so we can divide this list into half, left goes to left tree, right goes to right tree, the middle is cur root.  
We can iterate this process until the left index is greater than right index

# Cost
- Time: O(n), we still need to go through all elements in the given list into a node  
- Space: O(log n), every time, the list is into half and be hold there until child func returns.
