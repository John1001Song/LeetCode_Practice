# Approach
This question wants to merge two lists and smaller first, where the two lists are sorted.  
So, we can take node one by one from both lists, attach the smaller node on a result list. Do this iteration until one of the lists is empty. We then attach the other list to the result list.  
The key here is to have two nodes: result node and current node.  
result node is used to hold the starting position.  
current node is used to point at the smaller node and indicate where to attach for the next smaller node.  

# Cost
- Time: O(m+n), if two lists sizes are m and n
- Space: O(1), for operating cost, every time, we take two nodes to compare. O(m+n) if considering the storage for two lists.
