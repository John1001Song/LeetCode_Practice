# Approach
Please question want us to find a sub string in a given string, so we have to go through all the characters in the string. The tricky step is that after finding this sub string does not match at this position, then we cannot skip these sub string length, going to the new index, we need to go back to the starting index and +1.  
Once the two characters match, then we start to iterate all the characters in the given sub string needle.  
The corner case is at the tail of the sub string, if it is shorter than the given sub string, we can skip the checking and return -1.
