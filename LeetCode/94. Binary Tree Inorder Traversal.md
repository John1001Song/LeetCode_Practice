# Approach
Key here is to recursively call the func itself and define the base case when to stop the recursion.  
The tricky condition in the base case is: when the leave node has no left or right, then this leave node has val but its left and right nodes are None. So, we need to define the base case as those None left and None right, that is why we have node == None.  

# Cost:
- Time: O(n), we need to iterate all nodes and each step, we have this tree into left and right two parts, and each step, we collect one val, thus, all nodes need to collect
- Space: O(n + h), result in n length and h is the tree height
