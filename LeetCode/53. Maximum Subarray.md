# Approach
This approach is dynamic programming, but it does not require recursion function.  
The idea is that if it is worthy to add current element to previous sub array OR just fresh start at this element without including previous sub array.  
If previous sub array + cur element > cur element, then include this element  
If previous sub array + cur element <= cur element, then fresh start at this element  

# Cost
- Time: O(n), because we need to scan all elements  
- Space: O(1), because we may store only largest sum and cur sum.
