## Approach 1: Dynamic Program with Memory
use a memory dict to store the computing from previous stairs, avoiding repeating work  
Base cases are input is 1 or 2  
Recursive/inductive step is: current stairs combination = prev stairs + previs-1 stairs

### Complexity
- Time: O(n) each distinct value is computed once
- Space: O(n) the memory dict holds all values and recursion still happens on this dict. 

## Approach 2: DP from Bottom to Up
Use a list to store the combinations, where the index is the stair size and value is the combination value  
index 0 is 0, index 1 is 1 and index 2 is 2, these two are the initial values (base case)  
following indexes, index i = (i-1) + (i-2), for loop it until index n

### Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) for this solution. O(1) for an optimized one: no need to hold all computed results, just keep values from current index and previous two indexes. 


## Caution
- How to find the relationship between stair i, stair i-1 and stair i-2?  
Based on the observation of stair 2, 3, and 4, we can find the relationship. 
- Why dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] and no overlap computing required between dp[i-1] and dp[i-2]?
Based on our defintion, then boundary value reaches i-2, it stops, and its computing does not touch i-1.  
In this question, we define the dp[i] as the combination of stairs up to i, so we don't need to compute stair i+1, which is out of the scope. 
- Remember to use the pattern: 'base case' and 'inductive step'
