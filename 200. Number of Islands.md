## DFS Approach 
iterate through all positions at 2D arrays  
check its neighbors at up, left, down and right  
be careful for the index at the edge positions  
every visisted position will be flipped to 0 from 1
- Traversal
iterate all position and call dfs when this position is "1"  
meanwhile, island counter + 1
- Explore
this position with "1" is a begining,  
flip this position as "0"  
call dfs to check its neighbors on 4 directions  
need to deliciatly design the edge case, think about index out of bound, and visited position is "0". 

## Caution
- be careful to design the edge case in the dfs. when index is out of bound, just return and don't call grid[i][j] to raise error; when this position is "0", then return and no need to do extra steps. This approach is easier than thinking about when i is in bound, j is out of bound; i is out of bound, j is in bound, etc. 
- No need to use an additional map to label if this position is visited. Just flip "1" to "0" to save space. In a safe approach, it is better to make a copy of grid. 

## Complexity
- Time: O(m*n)
- Space: O(m*n)
