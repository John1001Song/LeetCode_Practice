## Summary

### Approach
Use DFS recursively  
watch out the base case and recursive case in the recursive function 

### Basic Analysis
Time complexity: O(n). Must visit all nodes even the tree height is O(log n)  
Space complexity: worst case a skewed tree: O(n); avg case a balanced tree: O(log n)

### Other
This question does not require tree construction code
