## Approach
use BFS to compare values at cur node and its left and right  
at the same time, we need to make sure that all the left branches are less than cur node and all the right branches are larger than current node   
thus we need to provide a valid range for current comparison  
after each iteration, we need to update the valid range values  

## Caution
Comparison should happen on this node and its low boundary or high boundary, NOT NOT NOT to compare current node and its two children  
must follow the binary search tree definition to define the function  
In BST, left branch should be less than current node, right branch should be greater than current node. This rule applies on all nodes at all heights. 

## Complexity
Time: O(n), because we need to check all nodes in worst case  
Space: O(n) because this tree is a stack structure to store all nodes; compare with Problem 605 flowerbed, that one has O(1) space complexity, because it does not use stack, but a list, which means every time, the function check one element and compute, no need to keep all elements while doing the computing.
