# ðŸš€ ML & Deep Learning Review Strategy (Step-by-Step)

### âœ… **Step 1: Clear Conceptual Understanding**
- Clearly define and explain each ML/DL concept.
- Understand "what," "why," and "how" for each algorithm or model.

### âœ… **Step 2: Intuition & Visualization**
- Use visualizations and analogies to build intuition.
- Interpret concepts graphically (e.g., CNN filters, attention mechanisms).

### âœ… **Step 3: Mathematical & Technical Foundations**
- Review key equations, loss functions, optimization logic briefly.
- Understand clearly when and why to use each technical detail.

### âœ… **Step 4: Coding & Implementation**
- Implement concepts clearly in code (PyTorch, TensorFlow).
- Test implementations on small datasets or toy examples.

### âœ… **Step 5: Practical Applications & Examples**
- Study real-world examples and research applications.
- Relate each concept directly to practical scenarios (especially radar perception).

### âœ… **Step 6: Summary & Key Takeaways**
- Summarize concepts clearly in your own words.
- List typical strengths, weaknesses, and practical usage scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example: Applying the Strategy (CNN Basics)**

- **Step 1: Conceptual Understanding**
  - Clearly define CNN: layers, filters, stride, padding, pooling.

- **Step 2: Intuition & Visualization**
  - Visualize CNN filters extracting image features.

- **Step 3: Math & Technical**
  - Understand convolution equations and output dimension formulas.

- **Step 4: Implementation**
  - Implement a basic CNN using PyTorch; test on MNIST or CIFAR10 dataset.

- **Step 5: Practical Examples**
  - Review CNN use in object detection (YOLO, SSD) and radar imagery.

- **Step 6: Summary**
  - CNN effectively captures spatial hierarchies; ideal for structured data (images, radar).
