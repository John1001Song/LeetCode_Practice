## âœ… Overall Logic (Step-by-step)

1. **Start** from the first number in the array.
2. For the **current number**, calculate its **complement** (`target - current_number`).
3. Check if this complement exists in the dictionary (`num_to_index`):
   - **If yes**, you've found the solution.  
     Return indices of:
     - the complement (previously stored),
     - the current number.
   - **If no**,  
     Add the **current number** and its **index** to the dictionary.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the array.

## ðŸš© Intuition (Simplified Explanation)

- You're **keeping track** of numbers you've already seen.
- For each new number, you ask yourself:  
  _"Have I already seen the number needed to reach the target?"_
- **If yes**, you immediately have your solution.
- **If no**, store this new number and continue searching forward.
