## Key Points
1. **Doubly linked list**
why use it? track which node (key, value) is the least used in a O(1) time cost

2. **How to correctly add a new node to doubly linked list?** 
-- attach a new node into list first, then update head and old node links between them  
2.1 assign the head's next (old node) to new node's next
2.2 assign head to new node's prev; at this moment, head prev and next links are not updated, only new node is attached to this link
2.3 link old node's prev to new node (head.next.prev)
2.4 update head's next to new node 

3. **How to correctly remove a node from doubly linked list?**
-- unlink this node; why this approach won't mess up the relationship? The updates won't change cur node's prev and next links, so we can correctly point to prev and next nodes  
3.1 this node's prev node attches to this node's next node
3.2 this node's next attaches to this node's prev

4. Be careful to the logic on how to update existing/non existing node in the cache
